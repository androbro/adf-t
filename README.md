# Vite + TypeScript + React App

## Introduction

This project is a simple yet powerful starting point for building web applications using Vite, TypeScript, and React. It provides a robust setup for rapid development, ensuring type safety and efficient bundling with Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. This project requires Node.js version 12.0.0 or later.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/androbro/adf-t
   cd adf-t
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
npm install

3. **Start the Development Server**
   
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
npm run dev

This will start the local development server and open the app in your default browser.

4. **Building for Production**
   
To build the application for production, run:
npm run build

This command will create a dist directory with your compiled project. You can deploy the contents of this directory to a web server.

5. **Additional Scripts**
## NPM Scripts Explained

- **dev**: 
  - `vite`
  - Starts the Vite development server for serving the app in development mode with features like hot module replacement.

- **tw**: 
  - `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
  - Runs Tailwind CSS to process the CSS file at `./src/input.css`, applies Tailwind transformations, and outputs to `./dist/output.css`. It watches for any changes in the input file and recompiles automatically.

- **api**: 
  - `json-server db.json --routes routes.json --no-cors=false`
  - Starts a JSON Server for a fake REST API using `db.json` as data source and `routes.json` for custom routes. CORS is enabled.

- **start**: 
  - `concurrently "npm run tw" "npm run api" "npm run dev"`
  - Uses `concurrently` to run the Tailwind CSS processor, JSON Server, and Vite development server simultaneously for a streamlined development workflow.

- **build**: 
  - `tsc && vite build`
  - Compiles TypeScript code and then creates a production build of the app with optimizations via Vite.

- **lint**: 
  - `eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0`
  - Runs ESLint for identifying and reporting issues in `.ts` and `.tsx` files. It reports unused eslint-disable directives and treats warnings as errors.

- **preview**: 
  - `vite preview`
  - Starts a local server for previewing the production build of your app, useful for testing before deployment.
